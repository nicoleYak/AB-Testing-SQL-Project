## Evaluating Marketing Campaign Effectiveness

**The Objective:** 
My goal is to determine the effectiveness of two marketing campaigns, Control and Test, in driving customer engagement and conversions. I will analyze various metrics to see which campaign performed better.

**A successful outcome:** 
A successful outcome would show that the Test campaign leads to better customer engagement and higher conversions than the Control campaign.

**Metrics to quantify success:**

1. **Website Clicks** – Higher number of clicks indicates better engagement.
2. **Searches** – More searches suggest increased interest in products.
3. **View Content** – Indicates more product views.
4. **Add to Cart** – Measures intent to purchase.
5. **Purchase** – Final measure of conversion success.
